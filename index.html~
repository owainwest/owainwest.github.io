<h1 class="title">Hi, I'm Owain West</h1>

<div id="outline-container-org81fbbae" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org81fbbae">Nice to meet you. Want my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>?</h2>

<p>
I'm a young computer scientist, programmer, and communicator with special interest in formal logic, machine intelligence, and computational modelling.
</p>

<p>
I have a relatively broad background, both academically and technologically. My Master's from UWaterloo is in Computer Science, and my undergraduate majors at UPenn were in Formal Logic, Computer Science, and Philosophy (though the bulk of my coursework was graduate mathematics). This background affords me a unique vantage point, allowing me to bring both technical and social skills to any role.
</p>

<p>
Technologically, I have expertise working with:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Formal methods/verification, eg in TLA+</li>
<li>Bioinformatics/proteomics techniques, including standards such as BLAST and novel approaches like BERT-type deep LM pretraining and finetuning</li>
<li>NLP techniques and tools, from the ML algorithm design level to the use of industry-standard platforms such as Alexa/Dialogflow, and for both financial and scientific purposes</li>
<li>A number of programming languages, most notably Python, Julia, NodeJS, OCaml, and K</li>
</ul>

<p>
Beyond the above, I am an intellectual omnivore and constant self-directed student. While my primary personal interest is in <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~weinstei/PQT.pdf">formal logic</a>, I also have deep interest in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/owainwest">music</a>, <a href="booklist.html">literature</a>, <a href="http://www.thedp.com/article/2015/07/mental-health-helpers-2019-facebook-group">mental health support and advocacy</a>, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/e4t9VSRWnrGcW9Cy5">photography</a>,  and myriad things besides. Foremost, I relish any opportunity to learn from my peers and seniors. 
</p>

<p>
If you're looking to hire a bright young programmer/data analyst/machine learning engineer/consultant, or for any other role that requires deep technical knowledge, interpersonal skills, and an aptitude for quick thinking, please send me an email at the address listed in my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>. 
</p>

<p>
I am primarily looking for positions in NYC or Toronto, and will also consider remote roles. I am a Canadian citizen and would either need either a TN Visa (no sponsorship required, though only certain roles acceptable), or H1-B Visa sponsorship, to work in the USA.
