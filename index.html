<h1 class="title">Hi, I'm Owain West</h1>

<div id="outline-container-org41ce0b9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org41ce0b9">Nice to meet you. Want my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org41ce0b9">
<p>
I'm a young computer scientist, coder, and communicator with special interest in formal logic, machine intelligence, and all things data.
</p>

<p>
I'm currently the Data Engineer at <a href="https://tickpick.com">TickPick</a>, where I'm tasked with managing and building on our data pipelines and infrastructure in support of analytical goals.
</p>

<p>
I have a relatively broad background academically, as well as <a href="resume.pdf">professionally</a>. My Master's from UWaterloo is in Computer Science, and my undergraduate majors at UPenn were in Formal Logic, Computer Science, and Philosophy (though the bulk of my coursework was graduate mathematics). This background affords me a unique vantage point, allowing me to bring technical, analytical, and personal skills to any role.
</p>

<p>
Technologically, I have expertise in:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A number of programming languages, most notably Python, Julia, SQL, OCaml, Rust, and K</li>
<li>Data Engineering, having ample experience with Snowflake, Airflow, dbt, Fivetran, Hightouch, and Stitch, as well as Azure and AWS clouds</li>
<li>Machine learning, with particular interest in ethical aspects; see eg some of my writing on <a href="https://owainwest.com/fairness_dynamics.pdf">"fairness dynamics"</a></li>
<li>NLP techniques and tools, from the algorithm design level to the use of industry-standard platforms such as Alexa/Dialogflow, and for both financial and scientific purposes</li>
<li>Formal methods and verification, eg in TLA+</li>
<li>Bioinformatics/proteomics techniques, including standards such as BLAST and novel approaches like BERT-type deep LM pretraining and finetuning</li>
</ul>

<p>
Beyond the above, I am an intellectual omnivore and constant self-directed student. I pride myself on my ability to "hit the ground running" and spin-up quickly and with high competency on new tasks. And while my primary personal interest is in <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~weinstei/PQT.pdf">formal logic</a>, I also have deep interest in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/owainwest">music</a>, <a href="booklist.html">literature</a>, <a href="http://www.thedp.com/article/2015/07/mental-health-helpers-2019-facebook-group">mental health support and advocacy</a>, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/e4t9VSRWnrGcW9Cy5">photography</a>, and myriad things besides.
</p>

<p>
 Foremost, I relish any opportunity to learn from my peers and seniors.
